Congratulations on your new membership! Your billing date will be the {{ membership.start_date|date:"jS" }}
of each month. If you have not already done so, please log in to your Nadine profile (link below) and make
sure we have a valid billing profile. We will assume you would like to stay at your current membership level
unless you tell us otherwise before your billing date arrives. If you have any questions or concerns, please
don't hesitate to ask us. In the mean time, welcome! We're so happy to have you as a part of the family.
